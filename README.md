## Project Description
This repository contains the code for evaluating the diagnostic ability of LLM that is integrated with context from PPPK (Panduan Praktik Profesional Kedokteran) using RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation). With this research, we aim to analyze and compare each LLM diagnostic ability and further utilize them to help doctors in Indonesia diagnose diseases.
